		    Welcome! This is the home page for Ted Markowitz at
		    the University of New Haven's Department of Electrical & Computer
		    Engineering and Computer Science. Here you'll find information on
		    the courses I teach as well as how to contact me when you need
		    assistance or advice.  Click on the links on this page for more
		    information.
		    <br/><br/>
		      Here's a brief bit on my background: I've worked in the
		      Information Technology arena for over 25 years with firms such as
		      American Express, Xerox, and Netscape Communications, where I've enjoyed
		      a number of positions that have included advanced technology research,
		      management of programming and IT support teams, as well as hands-on
		      development using the latest systems and tools. It was during this time
		      that I earned my MS in Computer Science from Columbia. Since 2000 I've
		      been a principle and Chief Architect with <a
			href="http://www.cognosys.net">Cognosys LLC</a>, which is a systems
		      consulting firm in Connecticut where I've worked on projects for both
		      large companies like AOL and other small firms as well.
		    <br/><br/>
			Most recently I've decided to once again take up teaching and am
			currently in the midst of completing my doctoral dissertation at
			Pace University in NY in the field of Machine Learning as it
			might be used to construct large, relevant training and testing
			databases in a more efficient and autonomous manner. This work
			is being pursued in conjunction with the <a
			  href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_projects.nsf/pages/spam.people.html">anti-spam
			  researchers at IBM Research</a> in Hawthorne, NY. Here's a <a
			  href="http://www.ceas.cc/2006/listabs.html#20.pdf">paper from
			  the CEAS 2006 conference</a> describing some of the work which
			will appear in the dissertation.
